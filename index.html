            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            This year we have the amazing
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TommyEdisonXP">Tommy Edison</a> as our keynote speaker and a theme of "one for all, all for one - accesibility" theme. In recognition
            of the importance of accessibility within our industry, we've also decided to have a contest where members of
            the community can demonstrate ways to improve accessibility, as well as share tools and best practices related
            to accessible website design and development.

            <h1>Rules</h1>
            <p>The UtahJS 2018 Conference Challenge, henceforth referred to simply as the "challenge" is a contest to improve
                the accessibility and accessibility-related content of this website. The winner of this challenge will be
                awarded one free ticket to the UtahJS 2018 Conference.</p>
            <p>Anyone may make a pull request to improve this website â€”
                <b>
                    <i>however</i>
                </b>, for a pull request to count toward the challenge (a) it must have
                <code>[entry]</code> prefixed to the pull request title, (b) it must be an accessibility-related contribution, and (c) it must
                be accepted by the Conference Organizers.</p>
            <p>An individual may make as many pull requests as they would like, however,
                <i>only one accepted pull request a week will count toward that individual's challenge entries</i>. For example,
                if someone makes 5 pull requests in a week, and 3 are accepted, the individual will have earned 1 challenge
                entry for the week.</p>
            <p>Conference organizers will decide which pull requests are accepted each week.</p>
            <p>At the end of the pull request period, the user with the most accepted pull requests will be announced. If there
                are multiple individuals with the same maximum number of accepted pull requests, their names will all be
                announced, and a random drawing will be held at the next UtahJS meet-up to determine which of them is the
                winner of the free ticket.</p>
